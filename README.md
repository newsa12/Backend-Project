## Project Overview

The website aims to digitize church administration, schedule management, worship service information, etc., allowing the congregation to access and manage various church-related information anytime, anywhere. Additionally, the website is expected to help promote the church and attract new members.

### Background

- **Target Audience**: All church members (Pastors, Elders/Deacons/Ministers, Congregation)
- **Problems**:
  - Currently, the church does not have a website, making it inconvenient to share church schedules and information.
  - Church schedules and announcements are still dependent on paper documents.
  - The website should enable more congregation members to participate in church activities.

### Problem Definition

- **Security**: Church documents are stored only on a desktop in the church office, posing potential security risks.
- **Bulletins**: Bulletins are provided on paper on Sunday mornings, and the congregation only learns about the bulletin upon arrival. Itâ€™s necessary to provide the bulletin in advance so that members can check the schedule ahead of time.
- **Promotion**: Church event records are only stored in the 'Band' app, limiting promotional effectiveness.
- **Trends**: Younger members and their children are actively using the internet and social media. The church needs to enhance its online promotion efforts.
- **Activity**: The access to online activities is limited for older members. It is necessary to create a space for all members, including younger generations, to engage in activities through a website and Instagram.

### Goals and Benefits

- Integrate all church schedules and event information for easier management.
- Allow the congregation to easily access necessary information and manage personal activities.
- Use the website to promote the church and attract new members.
